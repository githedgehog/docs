# VPCs and Namespaces

## VPC

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is similar to a public cloud VPC. It provides an isolated private network for the
resources with support for multiple subnets, each with user-provided VLANs and on-demand DHCP.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPC
metadata:
  name: vpc-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  ipv4Namespace: default # Limits to which subnets could be used by VPC to guarantee non-overlapping IPv4 ranges
  vlanNamespace: default # Limits to which switches VPC could be attached to guarantee non-overlapping VLANs

  defaultIsolated: true # Sets default behavior for the current VPC subnets to be isolated
  defaultRestricted: true # Sets default behavior for the current VPC subnets to be restricted

  subnets:
    default: # Each subnet is named, "default" subnet isn't required, but actively used by CLI
      dhcp:
        enable: true # On-demand DHCP server
        range: # Optionally, start/end range could be specified
          start: 10.10.1.10
          end: 10.10.1.99
          pxeURL: tftp://10.10.10.99/bootfilename # PXEURL (optional) to identify the PXE server to use to boot hosts; HTTP query strings are not supported
      subnet: 10.10.1.0/24 # User-defined subnet from ipv4 namespace
      gateway: 10.10.1.1 # User-defined gateway (optional, default is .1)
      vlan: "1001" # User-defined VLAN from VLAN namespace
      isolated: true # Makes subnet isolated from other subnets within the VPC (doesn't affect VPC peering)
      restricted: true # Causes all hosts in the subnet to be isolated from each other

    thrird-party-dhcp: # Another subnet
      dhcp:
        relay: 10.99.0.100/24 # Use third-party DHCP server (DHCP relay configuration), access to it could be enabled using StaticExternal connection
      subnet: "10.10.2.0/24"
      vlan: "1002"

    another-subnet: # Minimal configuration is just a name, subnet and VLAN
      subnet: 10.10.100.0/24
      vlan: "1100"

  permit: # Defines which VPCs could communicate to each other, applied on top of subnets "isolated" flag (doesn't affect VPC peering)
    - [subnet-1, subnet-2, subnet-3] # 1, 2 and 3 subnets could communicate to each other
    - [subnet-4, subnet-5] # Possible to define multiple lists
```

### Isolated and restricted subnets, permit lists

Subnets can be isolated and restricted, with the ability to define permit lists to allow communication between specific
isolated subnets. The permit list is applied on top of the isolated flag and doesn't affect VPC peering.

_Isolated subnet_ means that the subnet has no connectivity with other subnets within the VPC, but it could still be
allowed by permit lists.

_Restricted subnet_ means that all hosts in the subnet are isolated from each other within the subnet.

A Permit list is defined as a list of subnets that could communicate with each other.

### Third-party DHCP server

In case you use a third-party DHCP server by configuring `spec.subnets.<subnet>.dhcp.relay`, additional information is
added to the DHCP packet forwarded to the DHCP server to make it possible to identify the VPC and subnet. This
information is added under the RelayAgentInfo (option 82) in the DHCP packet. The relay sets two suboptions in the
packet:

* _VirtualSubnetSelection_ (suboption 151) is populated with the VRF which uniquely identifies a VPC on the Hedgehog
  Fabric and will be in `VrfV<VPC-name>` format, for example `VrfVvpc-1` for a VPC named `vpc-1` in the Fabric API.
* _CircuitID_ (suboption 1) identifies the VLAN which, together with the VRF (VPC) name, maps to a specific VPC subnet.

## VPCAttachment

A VPCAttachment represents a specific VPC subnet assignment to the `Connection` object which means a binding between an
exact server port and a VPC.
It basically leads to the VPC being available on the specific server port(s) on a subnet VLAN.

VPC could be attached to a switch that is part of the VLAN namespace used by the VPC.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCAttachment
metadata:
  name: vpc-1-server-1--mclag--s5248-01--s5248-02
  namespace: default
spec:
  connection: server-1--mclag--s5248-01--s5248-02 # Connection name representing the server port(s)
  subnet: vpc-1/default # VPC subnet name
  nativeVLAN: true # Optional, if true the port will be configured as a native VLAN port (untagged)
```

## VPCPeering

A VPCPeering enables VPC-to-VPC connectivity. There are two types of VPC peering:

* Local: peering is implemented on the same switches where VPCs are attached
* Remote: peering is implemented on the border/mixed leaves defined by the `SwitchGroup` object

VPC peering is only possible between VPCs attached to the same IPv4 namespace.

### Local VPC peering

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCPeering
metadata:
  name: vpc-1--vpc-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  permit: # Defines a pair of VPCs to peer
  - vpc-1: {} # Meaning all subnets of two VPCs will be able to communicate with each other
    vpc-2: {} # See "Subnet filtering" for more advanced configuration
```

### Remote VPC peering

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCPeering
metadata:
  name: vpc-1--vpc-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  permit:
  - vpc-1: {}
    vpc-2: {}
  remote: border # Indicates a switch group to implement the peering on
```

### Subnet filtering

It's possible to specify which specific subnets of the peering VPCs could communicate to each other using the `permit`
field.

```yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VPCPeering
metadata:
  name: vpc-1--vpc-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  permit: # subnet-1 and subnet-2 of vpc-1 could communicate to subnet-3 of vpc-2 as well as subnet-4 of vpc-2 could communicate to subnet-5 and subnet-6 of vpc-2
  - vpc-1:
      subnets: [subnet-1, subnet-2]
    vpc-2:
      subnets: [subnet-3]
  - vpc-1:
      subnets: [subnet-4]
    vpc-2:
      subnets: [subnet-5, subnet-6]
```

## IPv4Namespace

An IPv4Namespace defines non-overlapping VLAN ranges for attaching servers. Each switch belongs to a list of VLAN
namespaces with non-overlapping VLAN ranges.

```yaml
apiVersion: vpc.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: IPv4Namespace
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  subnets: # List of the subnets that VPCs can pick their subnets from
  - 10.10.0.0/16
```

## VLANNamespace

A VLANNamespace defines non-overlapping IPv4 ranges for VPC subnets. Each VPC belongs to a specific IPv4 namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: wiring.githedgehog.com/v1alpha2
kind: VLANNamespace
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: default
spec:
  ranges: # List of VLAN ranges that VPCs can pick their subnet VLANs from
  - from: 1000
    to: 2999
```
