# Install Fabric

!!! warning ""
    Under construction.

## Prerequisites

* Have a machine with access to internet to use Fabricator and build installer
* Have a machine to install Fabric Control Node on with enough NICs to connect to at least one switch using Front Panel
  ports and enough CPU and RAM ([System Requirements](./requirements.md)) as well as IPMI access to it to install OS
* Have enough [Supported Switches](./supported-devices.md) for your Fabric

## Main steps

This chapter is dedicated to the Hedgehog Fabric installation on the bare-metal control node(s) and switches, their
preparation and configuration.

Please, get `hhfab` installed following instructions from the [Download](../getting-started/download.md) section.

Main steps to install Fabric are:

1. Install `hhfab` on the machines with access to internet
    1. [Prepare Wiring Diagram](./build-wiring.md)
    1. [Select Fabric Configuration](./config.md)
    1. [Build Control Node configuration and installer](#build-control-node-configuration-and-installer)
1. [Install Control Node](#install-control-node)
    1. Install Flatcar Linux on the Control Node
    1. Upload and run Control Node installer on the Control Node
1. Prepare supported switches
    1. [Install Hedgehog ONIE (HONIE) on them](./onie-update.md)
    1. Reboot them into ONIE Install Mode and they will be automatically provisioned

## Build Control Node configuration and installer

It's the only step that requires internet access to download artifacts and build installer.

Once you've prepared Wiring Diagram, you can initialize Fabricator by running `hhfab init` command and passwing optional
configuration into it as well as wiring diagram file(s) as flags. Additionally, there are a lot of customizations
available as flags, e.g. to setup default credentials, keys and etc, please, refer to `hhfab init --help` for more.

The `--dev` options allows to enable development mode which will enable default credentials and keys for the Control
Node and switches:

* Default user with passwordless sudo for the control node and test servers is `core` with password `HHFab.Admin!`.
* Admin user with full access and passwordless sudo for the switches is `admin` with password `HHFab.Admin!`.
* Read-only, non-sudo user with access only to the switch CLI for the switches is `op` with password `HHFab.Op!`.

Alternatively, you can pass your own credentials and keys using `--authorized-key` and `--control-password-hash` flags.
Password hash can be generated using `openssl passwd -5` command. Further customizations are available in the config
file that could be passed using `--config` flag.

```bash
hhfab init --preset lab --dev --wiring file1.yaml --wiring file2.yaml
hhfab build
```

As a result, you will get the following files in the `.hhfab` directory or the one you've passed using `--basedir` flag:

* `control-os/ignition.json` - ignition config for the control node to get OS installed
* `control-install.tgz` - installer for the control node, it will be uploaded to the control node and run there

## Install Control Node

It's fully air-gapped installation and doesn't require internet access.

Please, download latest stable Flatcar Container Linux ISO from the
[link](https://stable.release.flatcar-linux.net/amd64-usr/current/flatcar_production_iso_image.iso) and boot into it
(using IPMI attaching media, USB stick or any other way).

Once you've booted into the Flatcar installer, you need to download `ignition.json` built in the prvious step to it and
run Flatcar installation:

```bash
sudo flatcar-install -d /dev/sda -i ignition.json
```

Where `/dev/sda` is a disk you want to install Control Node to and `ignition.json` is the `control-os/ignition.json`
file from previous step downloaded to the Flatcar installer.

Once the installation is finished, reboot the machine and wait for it to boot into the installed Flatcar Linux.

At that point, you should get into the installed Flatcar Linux using the dev or provided credentials with user `core`
and you can now install Hedgehog Open Network Fabric on it. Download `control-install.tgz` to the just installed Control
Node (e.g. by using scp) and run it.

```bash
tar xzf control-install.tgz && cd control-install && sudo ./hhfab-recipe run
```

It'll output log of installing the Fabric (including Kubernetes cluster, OCI registry misc components and etc), you should see
following output in the end:

```
...
01:34:45 INF Running name=reloader-image op="push fabricator/reloader:v1.0.40"
01:34:47 INF Running name=reloader-chart op="push fabricator/charts/reloader:1.0.40"
01:34:47 INF Running name=reloader-install op="file /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/hh-reloader-install.yaml"

deployment.apps/reloader-reloader condition met
01:35:15 INF Done took=3m39.586394608s
```

At that point, you can start interacting with the Fabric using `kubectl`, `kubectl fabric` and `k9s` preinstalled as
part of the Control Node installer.

You can now get HONIE installed on your switches and reboot them into ONIE Install Mode and they will be automatically
provisioned from the Control Node.
