# Introduction

The Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is an open networking platform that brings the user experience enjoyed by so many in the
public cloud to private environments. It comes without vendor lock-in.

The Fabric is built around the concept of VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), similar to public cloud offerings. It provides a
multi-tenant API to define the user intent on network isolation and connectivity, which is automatically transformed
into configuration for switches and software appliances.

You can read more about its [concepts](concepts/overview.md) and [architecture](architecture/overview.md) in the
documentation.

You can find out how to [download](getting-started/download.md) and try the Fabric on the self-hosted
[fully virtualized lab](vlab/overview.md) or on [hardware](install-upgrade/install.md).
