# Introduction

Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is an open networking platform that brings the user experience enjoyed by so many in the
public cloud to private environments. It comes without vendor lock-in.

Fabric is built around the concept of VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds), similar to the public clouds. It provides a
multi-tenant API to define the user intent on network isolation and connectivity, which gets automatically transformed
into configuration for switches and software appliances.

You can read more about its [concepts](concepts/overview.md) and [architecture](architecture/overview.md) in the
documentation.

You can find how to [download](getting-started/download.md) and try Fabric on the self-hosted
[fully virtualized lab](vlab/overview.md) or on [hardware](install-upgrade/overview.md).
