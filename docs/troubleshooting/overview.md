# Overview

## Inspecting the Fabric

The `kubectl fabric` plugin has an `inspect` functionality that shows an
overview of the fabric. `kubectl fabric inspect fabric` also shows detailed
information that is useful when diagnosing problems. To run the inspect
command:

```console
core@control-1 ~ $ kubectl fabric inspect fabric
Switches:
NAME        PROFILE           ROLE           GROUPS     SERIAL       STATE    GEN    APPLIED          HEARTBEAT
leaf-01     Virtual Switch    server-leaf    mclag-1    000000000    Ready    1/1    4 minutes ago    15 seconds ago
leaf-02     Virtual Switch    server-leaf    mclag-1    000000000    Ready    1/1    3 minutes ago    19 seconds ago
leaf-03     Virtual Switch    server-leaf    eslag-1    000000000    Ready    2/2    5 minutes ago    12 seconds ago
leaf-04     Virtual Switch    server-leaf    eslag-1    000000000    Ready    2/2    3 minutes ago    17 seconds ago
leaf-05     Virtual Switch    server-leaf               000000000    Ready    2/2    5 minutes ago    9 seconds ago
spine-01    Virtual Switch    spine                     000000000    Ready    1/1    3 minutes ago    19 seconds ago
spine-02    Virtual Switch    spine                     000000000    Ready    2/2    4 minutes ago    1 second ago
```

The output above is from the virtual testing environment. In a deployment of physical
switches, the profile would match the profile of the switch, and the correct
serial number would be displayed.

The `GROUP` column will be populated if you have redundancy configured on the
switches, either MCLAG, or ESLAG.

The `GEN` column shows the applied/current generation. If the numbers are equal
then there are no pending changes for the switches.

The `APPLIED` column shows the amount of time since the last change was applied.

The `HEARTBEAT` column shows the amount of time since the controller received a
heartbeat from the switch. In normal operation, the value in this column will be less
than 60 seconds.


The output of the commands can also be formatted as json or yaml. To see all the options available use:

```console
core@control-1 ~ $ kubectl fabric inspect --help
