The overlay network isolates control and data plane traffic between different virtual networks and the underlay network. Virtualization is achieved in the Hedgehog Fabric by encapsulating workload traffic over VXLAN tunnels that are source and terminated on the leaf switches in the network. The fabric uses BGP-EVPN/VXLAN to enable the creation and management of virtual networks on top of the physical one. The fabric supports multiple virtual networks over the same underlay network to support multi-tenancy. Each virtual network in the Hedgehog Fabric is identified by a VPC. The following subsections contain a high-level overview of how VPCs are implemented in the Hedgehog Fabric and its associated objects.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/fabric/#vpc","title":"VPC","text":"<p>The previous subsections have described what a VPC is, and how to attach workloads to a specific VPC. The following bullet points describe how VPCs are actually implemented in the network to ensure a private view the network.</p> <ul> <li>Each VPC is modeled as a VRF on each switch where there are VPC attachments defined for this VPC. The VRF is allocated   its own VNI. The VRF is local to each switch and the VNI is global for the entire fabric. By mapping the VRF to a VNI   and configuring an EVPN instance in each VRF, a shared L3VNI is established across the entire fabric. All VRFs   participating in this VNI can freely communicate with each other without the need for a policy. A VLAN is allocated   for each VRF which functions as an IRB VLAN for the VRF.</li> <li>The VRF created on each switch corresponding to a VPC configures a BGP instance with EVPN to advertise its locally   attached subnets and import routes from its peered VPCs. The BGP instance in the tenant VRFs does not establish   neighbor relationships and is purely used to advertise locally attached routes into the VPC (all VRFs with the same   L3VNI) across leaves in the network.</li> <li>A VPC can have multiple subnets. Each subnet in the VPC is modeled as a VLAN on the switch. The VLAN is only locally   significant and a given subnet might have different VLANs on different leaves on the network. A globally significant   VNI is assigned to each subnet. This VNI is used to extend the subnet across different leaves in the network and   provides a view of single stretched L2 domain if the applications need it.</li> <li>The Hedgehog Fabric has a built-in DHCP server which will automatically assign IP addresses to each workload depending   on the VPC it belongs to. This is achieved by configuring a DHCP relay on each of the server facing VLANs. The DHCP   server is accessible through the underlay network and is shared by all VPCs in the fabric. The inbuilt DHCP server is   capable of identifying the source VPC of the request and assigning IP addresses from a pool allocated to the VPC at   creation.</li> <li>A VPC by default cannot communicate to anyone outside the VPC and specific peering rules are required to allow   communication to external networks or to other VPCs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"architecture/fabric/#vpc-peering","title":"VPC Peering","text":"<p>To enable communication between 2 different VPCs, one needs to configure a VPC peering policy. The Hedgehog Fabric supports two different peering modes:</p> <ul> <li>Local Peering: A local peering directly imports routes from another VPC locally. This is achieved by a simple   import route from the peer VPC. In case there are no locally attached workloads to the peer VPC the fabric   automatically creates a stub VPC for peering and imports routes from it. This allows VPCs to peer with each other   without the need for a dedicated peering leaf. Traffic between the peered VPCs will not leave the switch that connects   them.</li> <li>Remote Peering: Remote peering is implemented using a dedicated peering switch/switches which is used as a rendezvous   point for the 2 VPC's in the fabric. The set of switches to be used for peering is determined by configuration in the   peering policy. When a remote peering policy is applied for a pair of VPCs, the VRFs corresponding to these VPCs on   the peering switch advertise default routes into their specific VRFs identified by the L3VNI. All traffic that does   not belong to the VPCs is forwarded to the peering switch which has routes to the other VPCs and gets forwarded from   there. This peering mode was introduced as a workaround to previous limitations of the fabric; users are recommended   to use local peering instead.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"architecture/overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Hedgehog Open Network Fabric leverages the Kubernetes API to manage its resources.

Managing a small number of switches and routers this way is workable, but cumbersome, and it only gets more painful when the network grows. Managing switches and servers with Kubernetes is similar to managing pods and applications with Kubernetes: it provides assistance for deployment, scaling, and management of the network appliances.</p> <p>For example, if the administrator of a Kubernetes cluster wants to create a new Nginx pod, they write down the YAML file describing the pod name, the container image, any ports that the pod needs exposed, and what namespace to run the pod in. After the YAML file is created, a simple <code>kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml</code> is all that the administrator needs to run in order for the pod to be scheduled. </p> <p>With the Hedgehog Fabric, the same principles apply to managing network resources. Administrators create a YAML file to configure a VPC. The YAML file describes the IP address range for the private cloud, for example the <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> space. It also describes any VLANs that the private cloud needs. After the desired options are in the file, administrators can push the configuration to the switch with a mere <code>kubectl apply -f vpc1.yaml</code>, and within a few seconds the switch configuration is live.</p>"},{"location":"faq/overview/#what-is-a-virtual-private-cloud-vpc","title":"What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?","text":"<p>A VPC provides layer 3 logical isolation inside of a network.

A VPC can be a logical separation of workloads. By separating these workloads additional controls are available. The logical separation doesn't have to be the traditional database, web, and compute layers it could be development teams who need isolation, it could be tenants inside of an office building, or any separation that allows for better control of the network.

Subsequent lease requests will use the configured lease duration.</p> <p>If a user elects to use their own DHCP server or statically assign IP addresses, it is recommended that the user set the following <code>sysctl</code> values on the end hosts:</p> <pre><code>net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_notify=1\nnet.ipv4.conf.default.arp_announce=1\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"user-guide/vpcs/#example-route-output","title":"Example Route Output","text":"<p>If the fabric DHCP server is enabled and serving a default route:</p> <p><pre><code>user@server ~$ ip route\ndefault via 10.10.0.1 dev enp2s1.1000 proto dhcp src 10.10.0.4 metric 1024\n10.10.0.1 dev enp2s1.1000 proto dhcp scope link src 10.10.0.4 metric 1024 # Route for VPC subnet gateway\n</code></pre> If the fabric DHCP server is enabled and not serving a default route:</p> <pre><code>user@server ~$ ip route\n10.10.0.1/24 via 10.10.0.1 dev enp2s1.1000 proto dhcp src 10.10.0.4 metric 1024 # Route for VPC subnet gateway\n10.10.0.1 dev enp2s1.1000 proto dhcp scope link src 10.10.0.4 metric 1024\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"vlab/demo/","title":"Demo on VLAB","text":""},{"location":"vlab/demo/#goals","title":"Goals","text":"<p>The goal of this demo is to show how to use VPCs, attach and peer them and run test connectivity between the servers.

Different values for <code>AppliedG</code> and <code>CurrentG</code> mean that the switch is in the process of applying the configuration.</p> <p>At that point Fabric is ready and you can use <code>kubectl</code> and <code>kubectl fabric</code> to manage the Fabric.
